# .NET Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet
Shows [Big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) time and space complexities of common algorithms used in .NET and Computer Science. You can see which collection type or sorting algorithm to use at a glance to write the most efficient code. This is also useful for those studying Computer Science in University or for technical interview tests where Big-O notation questions can be fairly common depending on the type of company you are apply to.
